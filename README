Welcome to the data manager app. This app is a data pipeline that helps to gather historical materials data and merge them into a master CSV file; as well as provides functionality for bringing new data to the master CSV file at will.

The app takes an arbitrary number of CSV data files in a source path and merges them into a master CSV file. To use, simply drop all of your data files into a single folder, run the app, point it to the path where your data is stored, provide a destination where you want your master output file written, and hit go. The app will collect all CSV files in the path and merge them.

The app also has a special class to generate a CSV file from an arbitrary number of lab data files. Since there are two types of lab data files, the SDMS will generate two individual ‘combined’ CSV files of the collected input files. As long as the filenames in the source path match the pattern Hall*txt or ICP*txt, the app will find them, collect them, wrangle them into the correct format, generate individual lab1.csv and lab2.csv files, and add them to the master merged CSV. The best part is that it all happens under the hood - the only thing that the person executing the program has to do is to input the source and destination paths.
